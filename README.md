# CausalDirectionality
Investigation of complexity-based criteria for determining the causal direction from observational data.

The code in this repository was used for the criteria presented and the experiments of the paper:

'Inferring Causal Direction from Observational Data: A Complexity Approach', Nikolaos Nikolaou and Konstantinos Sechidis, presented at the Machine Learning for Pharma and Healthcare Applications
ECML--PKDD 2020 Workshop (PharML 2020).
